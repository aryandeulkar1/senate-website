This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash or powershell idk doesnt matter
npm run dev #this is what i used when developing, download one of these on your "machine" for dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. it will give you the local host link in terminal when you enter the command

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file, again its named page.js under the "app" folder in your code editor. the path is obv app/page.js

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

you COULD learn next.js right but if you were trusted with updating the website i think youll be just fine, use chatgpt if you have to 

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

## Deploy on Vercel
Dont really worry abt this when you commit code from vscode in the bash terminal to the repo, it will auto update to vercel just look at the checks!!

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

good luck and dont break the site :)
